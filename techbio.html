		<pre>Started using linux since 2022 simple FVRCA3DJNZ2XQIDNNFXHICQ with gui to help handle the system
until now I'm multiplexer user who can't leave a window manager been code savvy,deploying servers,crypto storage,etc
dual boot arch and void linux jump from cli to tui to another cli
contributing only to the open source projects I use
I name that the Ajna evolution
It's not about Linux the Kernel but the open source movement around it and how people around the world collaborate to build free software
I'm not fan of GNU nor linux or it's policy I just want to have full control of my machine
That why i disliked windows in first place
but this community helped me much to archive this evolutionary control
